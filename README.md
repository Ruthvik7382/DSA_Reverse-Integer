# DSA_Reverse-Integer
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
At first I started from basic i.e by using some if-else conditions and for loops which takes more time and memory later I update the code with while conditions and optimised the code accordingly which showed me a 87% less running time
